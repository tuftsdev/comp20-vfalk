<h1> Assignment 4: Security </h1>
<h4> Prepared by: Vince Falk </h4>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>

			<p> For assignment 4, I was hired to exploit the vulernability of Josh Kaltman's assignments 2 and  3. For assignment 2, Josh created an interactive map similar to the infamous "Marauders Map" as seen in the Harry Potter series. Instead of wizards and witches, Josh's map displayed other students in his Comp 20 class as markers using a Google Api. He included himself on the map with a unique marker, and each of his classmates has the default marker provided by Google, with am info box stating their login name, message, and how far away they are from Josh.  </p>
			<p> For assignment 2, Josh used a database created by Ming in order to get the locations of his classmates. This was implemented by sending a request to Ming's server hosted on Heroku.com. If his request was correct, Ming returned a JSON feed of the locations of his classmates. Therefore, for assignment 3, Josh had to create a similar server to serve his assignment 2. Instead of just being responsible for returning a JSON feed of the locations of his classmates, he created a separete html page to list all of the checkins, as well as being responsible of taking a request for the latest check-in for a particular login name, and returning the latest check in. There were certain criteria required for the format of both the list of checkins on the html page and the response for the latest location of a certain login name. Each criteria exploited will be included below in the "Abstract of Findings" section in this report. </p>

	<h2> Methodology </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
			<p> For haking into Josh's assignment 2 and 3, I used both curl requests and query string input. By query string input, I tried to break Josh's safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/latest.json by entering different keys and values. Example:</p>	
			<div class = "center"> <p> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/latest.json?login=SomethingMaliciousHere </p> </div>

	<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
		
		<p> The security and privacy issues in Josh's assignment 2 and 3 came from incorrect input as well as malicious input. Essentially, I was able to input data that should not have been accepted. For example, entering a word instead of a number for a classmate's latitude or longitude. Secondly,  I was able to add data that actually added new functionality to Josh's assignment 2 and 3 (I created a link to a YouTube video) Lastly, I was able to add data that stores a cookie on the user's browser. Cookies are provided by the server and are basically messages stored on a users browser in a text file. If you ever signed into Facebook, Google, or another website that asks if they would "like to remember you", they are asking to store a unique cookie on your browser so everytime you go to that website, your unique cookie gets sent to the server and automatically logs you in. </p>
