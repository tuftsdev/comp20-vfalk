<h1> Assignment 4: Security </h1>
<h4> Prepared by: Vince Falk </h4>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>

			<p> For assignment 4, I was hired to exploit the vulernability of Josh Kaltman's assignments 2 and  3. For assignment 2, Josh created an interactive map similar to the infamous "Marauders Map" as seen in the Harry Potter series. Instead of wizards and witches, Josh's map displayed other students in his Comp 20 class as markers using a Google Api. He included himself on the map with a unique marker, and each of his classmates has the default marker provided by Google, with am info box stating their login name, message, and how far away they are from Josh.  </p>
			<p> For assignment 2, Josh used a database created by Ming in order to get the locations of his classmates. This was implemented by sending a request to Ming's server hosted on Heroku.com. If his request was correct, Ming returned a JSON feed of the locations of his classmates. Therefore, for assignment 3, Josh had to create a similar server to serve his assignment 2. Instead of just being responsible for returning a JSON feed of the locations of his classmates, he created a separete html page to list all of the checkins, as well as being responsible of taking a request for the latest check-in for a particular login name, and returning the latest check in. There were certain criteria required for the format of both the list of checkins on the html page and the response for the latest location of a certain login name. Each criteria exploited will be included below in the "Abstract of Findings" section in this report. </p>

	<h2> Methodology </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
			<p> For haking into Josh's assignment 2 and 3, I used both curl requests and query string input. Curl requests are basically a way to send data to a website. If a website requires that data be sent to it, essentially you can send that website whatever you want (text, image, video, hyperlinks, files, etc.). I did this via my terminal, simply writing the words "curl --data 'DataToBeSentToTheWebsite' http://TheWebsiteYouWantToSendDataTo.com". There is a specific format to follow when entering data that you will be able to see later on in my examples. </p>
			<p> By query string input, I tried to break Josh's safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/latest.json by entering different keys and values. Example:</p>	
			<div class = "center"> <p> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/latest.json?login=SomethingMaliciousHere </p> </div>

	<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
		
		<p> The security and privacy issues in Josh's assignment 2 and 3 came from incorrect input as well as malicious input. Essentially, I was able to input data that should not have been accepted. For example, entering a word instead of a number for a classmate's latitude or longitude. Secondly,  I was able to add data that actually added new functionality to Josh's assignment 2 and 3 (I created a link to a YouTube video) Lastly, I was able to add data that stores a cookie on the user's browser. Cookies are provided by the server and are basically messages stored on a users browser in a text file. If you ever signed into Facebook, Google, or another website that asks if they would "like to remember you", they are asking to store a unique cookie on your browser so everytime you go to that website, your unique cookie gets sent to the server and automatically logs you in. </p>
			
	<h2> Issues Found </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
		<ol>
				<li> Invalid Input </li>
				<ul>
					<li> Was able to add words as latitudes and longitudes, stored in database without an error message. </li>	
					<li> POST API :- Stored invalid input in the database</li>
					<li> Low: Individual markers were distorted and the list of "Who Checked In" showed the invalid logins. However, the application still ran. </li>
					<li> I used curl to input invalid data. Example :</li>
					<div class = "center"> <p>curl --data "login=mchow&lat=40&lng=<span class = "highlightme">dsf</span>&message=this" https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </p> </div>

					<p><img src = "MongoScreenshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Josh's Mongo DB" /></p>
					<li> Simply filtering the input for numbers only in latitude and longitude would fix this.  </li>
					<p></p>
				</ul>
				<li> Cross-Site Scripting with Images</li>
				<ul>

					<li> Was able to add images as messages via Cross Site Scripting using the IMG tag </li>
					<li> GET and POST API  </li>
					<li> High: Anyone could add additional HTML or Javascript or modify the existing code. Hackers can violate Same Origin Policy. Unless corrected in the database, any images injected will remain visible to other users until manually deleted in the database. While this could include innapropriate content, even the unprofessionalism of random images could cost Josh his job as a web developer. </li>
					<li> I used curl to input invalid data. Example :</li>
					<div class = "center"> <p> "curl --data "login=mchow&lat=-10&lng=10&message=<span class = "highlightme">&ltIMG SRC='https://memecrunch.com/image/514605afafa96f771d00002d.jpg?w=400;'>"</span> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/sendLocation"</p> </div>
					<p><img src = "CheckinSpong.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Josh's Checkins page" /></p>
					<p><img src = "MapSpong.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Josh's map" /></p>
					<li> This can be fixed by checking that the input does not have any of the special characters used in cross-site scripting. A technical solution I found from a previous student's security assignment is using "str.match(/[\d\w\s\]|[\~\!\@\#\$\^\*\-\_\+\;]*/g).join('')". This is checking for characters that match the contents inside the parenthesis, and takes them out of the string.</li>
					<p></p>
				</ul>

				<li> Cross-Site Scripting with Alert Messages</li>
				<ul>

					<li> Was able to create alert messages via Cross Site Scripting using the IMG tag </li>
					<li> GET API </li>
					<li> High: Aside from justification listed above in Issue #2, pop up alert messages need to be closed via the default "ok" button. This feature is not only not a part of Josh's original code, but hackers could included advertisments or a redirect via clicking the "ok" button </li>
					<li> I used curl to input data with a BODY tag. Because all HTML sites have this tag, I knew Josh's code would read the ONLOAD function as well, rendering the alert message. Example :</li>
					<div class = "center"> <p> curl --data "login=mchow&lat=-10&lng=10&message=<span class = "highlightme">&ltBODY ONLOAD=alert('HACKCITY')>"</span> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p> </div>
					<p><img src = "popUp.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Josh's Checkins page with alert message" /></p>
					
					<li> This can be fixed by the same method included in Issue #2, sanitizing the user input to include special characters. In this instance, Josh could check for the word "alert".</li>
					<p></p>
				</ul>
				
				<li> Cross-Site Scripting: Creating a Hyperlink to Redirect User </li>
				<ul>
					<li> Was able to create hyperlinked via Cross Site Scripting using the IMG tag </li>
					<li> GET/POST API </li>
					<li> High: Aside from justification listed above in Issue #2, creating a hyperlink to another malicious website is extremely problematic. Different than an image, the change of text color is much less easier to detect. For example, only one of the messages in one of the markers had an active hyperlink. Josh could never catch it and the hacker could redirect the user to a malicious site such as adertisements or obscene content. Josh would be responsible for this redirect. In this instance, I created a hyperlink to redirect the user to a 10 hour loop of spongebob laughing. This was present in Josh's map, under a specific marker and linked to the distance from Josh. The hyperlink was also created on Josh's index page showing "Who Checked In".</li>
					<li> I used curl to input invalid data. Example :</li>
					<div class = "center"> <p> curl --data "login=mchow&lat=-10&lng=10&message=<span class = "highlightme">&lta href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnnBgRHlRRc'>"</span> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p> </div>
					<p><img src = "hyperMap.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Josh's map with hyperlinked distance" /></p>
					<p><img src = "hyperText.jpg" alt= "Screenshot of Josh's index with hyperlinked data" /></p>
					<p><img src = "Sponge.jpg" alt= "Screenshot of Spongebob video" /></p>

					
					<li> This can be fixed by the same method included in Issue #2, sanitizing the user input to exclude special characters. In this instance, Josh could check for the word "href".</li>
					<p></p>
				</ul> 

				<li> Cross-Cite Scripting: Creating a Cookie </li>
				<ul>

					<li> Was able to create cookie that gets put on the users web browser upon visiting Josh's index page </li>
					<li> GET/ API </li>
					<li> High: Aside from justification listed above in Issue #2, creating a cookie for Josh's website is extremely problematic. Hackers can create cookies to steal information from users accessing Josh's website. Obviously, this means hackers can also store information in the user's browser without the user knowing. Once again, Josh would be responsible for this and could get in serious criminal trouble by leaking user data to malicious hackers. </li>
					<li> I used curl to input data as the message parameter. I checked whether or not I was successful by using Google Chrome developer tools, opening "resources", then "cookies". After I sent a curl request, I refreshed the page and saw the cookie with a value of "HACKCITY" Example :</li>
					<div class = "center"> <p> curl --data "login=mchow&lat=40&lng=-70&message=<span class = "highlightme">&ltBODY ONLOAD=document.cookie='HACKCITY'>"</span> https://safe-shore-4767.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p> </div>
					<p><img src = "cookie.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Josh's index with cookie showing in Chrome developer tools" /></p>

					
					<li> This can be fixed by the same method included in Issue #2, sanitizing the user input to exclude special characters. In this instance, Josh could check for the word "href". Another way is to include an "HttpOnly" flag in a "Set-Cookie HTTTP" response header. This way, any cookie you create cannot be accessed by any hackers or other client side scripting. (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTPOnly#What_is_HttpOnly.3F) </li>
					<p></p>

				</ul> 

		</ol>
	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	<div class = "hline"></div>
		<p> All of the vulnerabilities I found during my assessment can be fixed with filtering requests and updating response headers. Excluding special symbols will take care of most Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, at least the ones I have exploited. Another key way to filter requests is only accepting a certain type of variable for input. For your latitude and longitute variables, simply making sure the input are numbers will fix the problem. However, I would like to point out that I am an extremely novice hacker and was able to do a significant amount of damage to your assignment 2 and 3. In terms of accademics, what I did could potentially make you lose all points by getting rid of formatting and neccessary features. A malicious student could sabatoge a fellow student fairly easily. Before this assessment, I would have had no way to tell what was going wrong. All in all, fantastic excercise to improve my hacker and security ignorance! </p>
