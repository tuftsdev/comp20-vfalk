README FOR LAB 5-DUCKHUNT

1. ALL ASPECTS OF THE WORK HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED 

2. ASKED ALEXANDRA BENBADIS ABOUT WHERE TO INCLUDE SOURCES FOR THE IMAGES (INCLUDED ABOVE MY FUNCTION IN GAME.JS)

3. THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME AROUND 4 HOURS TO COMPLETE. I WAS EXTREMELY STUCK ON FIGURING OUT THE SYNTAX OF JS AND HOW TO ACCESS THE DUCKHUNT IMAGES. HOWEVER, THE RESOURCES INCLUDED IN THE LAB HELPED TREMENDOUSLY.
