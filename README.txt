Lab 9: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio 

1. What is the purpose of this Git repository? 
	Obviously, this Git repository is not only a way for us to submit our
	homeworks and assignments, but also serves as a portfolio (hence the
	name, finalizing your learning portfolio). This is going to be incredibly
	useful for me as I enter the tech industry from more of a business
	point of view, and less of a development angle. Showing my work and
	what I am capable of after coming into this course with 0 base knowledge
	of web programming will be a great way for employers and bosses to 
	understand my ability to learn quickly.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	My favorite assignment was mapchat. Honestly, when I was first starting,
	I had no idea where to begin. I was super intimidated and honestly thought
	I would never get it. However, using examples and reading documentation,
	I ended up getting a huge portion of it done relatively quickly. I think
	it showed me that web development and JavaScript in general is unique 
	that there are a ton of examples and API's that essentially "do things 
	for you". However, you still need to have the knowledge to be able to 
	learn their API's and how to interact with everything relatively quickly.
	I think this is a skill that will carry me very far. As I enter a job at
	NetSuite where the platform is already created but I need to be able to
	manipulate their API's and customize dashboards, I will have a significant 
	leg up on everybody else in my hiring class.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	Exponentially. Unlike some other students, I had 0 exposure to web
	programming before taking this course. Just the understanding I have for
	websites, the "request/response" concept of how clients intereact with 
	servers is invaluable. Things I used to see on the internet that I thought
	"there's no way I could ever understand how they do that" now make a lot 
	more sense. Being comfortable looking at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
	when I do "Inspect Element" on a webpage is something that is entirely 
	new to me and something I would not be able to do without this course.

4. What was the most importaant thing that you learned in this course? Cite 
	two examples.
	1 example I already touched upon is the ability to use pre-built API's. 
	I had no idea things such as Faccebook authentication or the Google 
	API could be as easy to use and implement as they are. This is incredibly
	useful and important to me because unlike comp11 and comp15, I feel like
	I can use this in my career (the type of coding: Unfortunately, I doubt
	I will ever be dealing with C++ given my career path I am already on).
	
	Another important example is the concept of web security. Even though
	we just did 1 assignment on security, it opened my eyes to the endless
	possibilities of areas I can leave myself vulnerable to. I had no idea 
	the vulerabilities of websites and that is partially because I did not
	fully understand how websites worked. The general concepts of this course
	more so than the nity-gritty details of the actual code I wrote I think 
	will serve me extremely well in my future, and once again give me a leg up
	on many of my coworkers. I also would argue that having this general 
	knowledge is going to be similar to having general mechanical knowledge
	for working on your own car. Due to technology and the role it plays in 
	the world today, I will be able to solve problems much easier than those
	who have never taken a course in web programming. I would like to go as 
	far and compare someone who knows about cars... yes, while I am not a 
	web developer, I feel confident that I could at least troubleshoot a 
	technological problem. Just as someone who knows a little bit about cars
	will never be as good as a mechanic, but at least they can change their 
	own oil, know somewhat where a problem may be in their car, and just have
	those basic skills to be at least somewhat self-sufficient.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve
   deeper into?
	I would like to continue to learn more about javascript and understand
	exactly what it can do in more complex web applications. NetSuite's 
	platform is based off of javascript and during our interviews, some 
	employees talked about when customizing a "dashboard" for a client, 
	sometimes you have the ability to "script". Basically, they were saying
	in some cases, it is very useful if you can add a line or two of javascript
	in order to accomplish something. I am very very interested in seeing if
	my level of javascript knowledge would be enough to do something like
	that with the software. I also will definitely keep you in the loop as
	I start work. NetSuite offers its new hires (analyst training program
	I am going to be enrolled in) an opportunity to compete against one 
	another. They give us time to create an application using their platform
	to solve some business need. You can make up any business need you 
	want, and you present your project to the team. The winning applications
	move on to the final round with a chance to go to their annual conference in 
	California, as well as all the the recognition of being the project 
	winner of your class. I am EXTREMELY competitive and cannot wait to 
	move up in my career, so this would be a great opportunity to really 
	shine and standout amongsts my coworkers. Honestly, if there are any
	good online tutorials, books, etc. you think would be helpful for me to
	do next semester on the side to get my javascript knowledge and abilities
	better, I would love any advice you can give me.

***SIDE NOTE***
Thank you for a great semester. I know almost everyone has endless great
things to say about you as a professor and I can see why. Truly one of my
most useful courses, and it is great to have a professor that cares so 
much about his/her students. I felt the same way about Chris Gregg after
taking comp15 with him. This is why I always tell my friends to take his 
courses and will continue to do the same for the courses you teach.
Also, I think the career advice and overall life advice you give to your 
students is invaluable. I keep hearing how colleges are doing a great job 
in training smart people, but a horrible job in training people who can interact
in the work place. Obviously, an arguement could be made that the latter of 
the two is more important, so I think your efforts and the efforts of the 
compsci department to create well rounded, socially aware students will set 
Tufts Computer Science graduates apart from any other school.
