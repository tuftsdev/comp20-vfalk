Creating README.txt for Assignment 2: MapChat

1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. I tested using both simpleHTTPServer and using my github account and both ways of viewing show results that complete all requirements for this assignment.
2. Other than using example from Ming and listening to his suggestions in class, I have not collaborated with anyone for this assignment.
3. This assignement took me around 10 hours to complete.
